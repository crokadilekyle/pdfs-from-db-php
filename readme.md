Create PDFs from Database Data

This is some code I wrote for generating PDF files from a database table.

To use this, first you must copy the env.example.php file and save it as env.php.  Here you can enter your information to connect to your database.

Then in index.php you can grab the data from your database and create a pdf however you want.  Check out <a href="http://www.fpdf.org/">fpdf.org</a> for more information on how to customize your pdf.

Note, I intended to only use this locally for a one time project so I was not worried about database security.  Be sure to impliment any security needs you may have!
